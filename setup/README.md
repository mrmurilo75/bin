# This is a bundle of setup scripts

- the main idea is to facilitate setting up in a debian-based enviroment (my testing setup is of Pop!OS)

<span></span>

The setups scrips are here on the home along with some utility-scripts.

There are three incremental setup levels for different enviroments/machines:
 * essencials - basically updating linux build
 * minimal    - browser and other cli necessities (running essencials is optional)
 * basic      - multi-browser and more utilities
 * devs       - most things needed for a working development/study environment
 * extras     - other things that may come in hand

To start simply run the script wanted from the setup/ folder
```$ ./set-[setup level].sh```
